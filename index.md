# 04---Structure web pages with HTML

### Wireframing

1. Practice used by designers which allows them to drawout and plan a layout that they have in their mind. It is easy to change and put your thoughts down on paper so you have a direstion that you want to go planneded out
2. There are mutiple tools and programs to do wireframing
3. Before you start wireframing you need to know who your audience is by way of research, detailing requirements, creating user personas, defining use cases and complementing with competitor research.
4. Creat a cheat sheet with your user and business requirements, cases, personas and new ideas you came across
5. *Remember: you’re outlining and representing features and formats, not illustrating in mighty fine detail.*
6. How can you organise the content to support your users’ goals?
Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

Three key principles
1. Clarity
2. Confidence
3. Simplicity is key


### HTML Basics

1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
3.The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
